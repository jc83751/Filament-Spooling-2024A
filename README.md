# Filament-Spooling-2024A
DMMS Autumn 2024 - Filament Spooling Project.
Hello,
the material you see here was crated in a 12 week period for the subject Design in Mechanical and Mechatronic Systems 
in Autumn 2024 at the University of Technology Sydney. We hope that our compilation of materials produced
will be of good use to you.

You are free to use this in any way you like, however, should you publish anything from here please credit 
us for any work or research we have conducted as this took a lot of time and effort.
